Pathfinding TODOs:

Pikachu-class (walk + jump):
- Penalize paths that go through water
- Optimization: cache tile-type checks (required for multi-tile entities)
- Leave a buffer around the player when following

Other classes:
- Multi-grid-cell entities
- Entities that can break some cell types
- Diggers (move through ground-type cells)
- Swimmers (walk, jump, and water-surface)
- Divers (move through fluids)
- Levitate (move through air cells)
- Flyers ("jump" through air cells - constant motion?)
- Phasing (levitate + move through solid cells?)
- Combinations of the above attributes

It may be that digging, swimming, and levitatation are the same ability just
applied to different types of cells.
